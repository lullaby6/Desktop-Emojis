# Desktop Emojis

A emoji friend on the bottom-right side of your screen!

Made with pygame and win32 apis.

## Requeriments

- ```Windows```
- ```Python```

## Run

Clone or download this repository and open the file ```main.pyw``` or run the command:

```bash
python main.pyw
```

if you want autorun open the file ```autorun.pyw.bat```

## Download

[Click here to download](https://github.com/lullaby6/Desktop-Emojis/releases/download/v1.0/Desktop-Emojis.zip) (.exe)

You need unzip the downloaded file, and if you want autorun open the file ```autorun.bat```

Warning: in the executable version (.exe) the emoji does not have permissions to be displayed above other windows, so it does not have the fixed display property, therefore I recommend to run it with python if you are familiar with it.
